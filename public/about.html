<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Bhumi, and I am a passionate and curious individual with a growing interest in the world of technology, especially in web development and creative digital design.
   I enjoy working with HTML and learning how to build clean, structured, and user-friendly web pages. With every new concept I explore, I find myself more excited about the endless possibilities that web development offers.
   I believe that even the smallest ideas can become powerful when brought to life through code.</p>

<p>Beyond just the technical side, I also enjoy the creative process — thinking about how users experience a website,
   how to make it visually appealing, and how to present content in a way that feels engaging and thoughtful.
    Whether it’s through layout, color, or interaction, I strive to create digital spaces that are both functional and beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m someone who believes in continuous learning. With every project, mistake, and success,
  I grow a little more. I’m open to new challenges and eager to expand my skills in HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
  This is just the beginning of my journey in tech, and I’m excited to see where it leads.</p>
